# 🧑‍⚖️ AI-Based Legal Chatbot for Public Legal Assistance

## 📌 Project Title

**An Intelligent AI-Based Legal Chatbot for Improving Public Access to Legal Information**

---

## 📖 Project Description

Access to legal information is often limited due to complex legal language, high consultation costs, and lack of awareness. This project presents an **AI-based legal chatbot** designed to assist users by providing accurate and easy-to-understand legal information through a conversational interface.

The chatbot uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to analyze user queries, identify intent, and retrieve relevant responses from a structured legal knowledge base. The system focuses on common legal domains such as consumer rights, cyber laws, and basic legal procedures, making it useful for the general public.

## 🎯 Objectives

* To improve public access to legal information
* To simplify complex legal terminology
* To provide instant responses to common legal queries
* To reduce dependency on manual legal assistance
* To promote legal awareness and access to justice

---

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* **Backend:** Python (Flask / FastAPI)
* **AI & NLP:**

  * Natural Language Processing
  * TF-IDF / Word Embeddings
  * Intent Classification
* **Database:** Structured Legal FAQ Dataset

---

## 🧠 System Architecture

1. User submits a legal query through the web interface
2. Query preprocessing using NLP techniques
3. Intent classification and similarity matching
4. Retrieval of relevant legal response
5. Response displayed to the user via chatbot

---

## ⚙️ Methodology

* Data collection from publicly available legal resources
* Data preprocessing (tokenization, stop-word removal, normalization)
* Feature extraction using NLP techniques
* Intent classification using machine learning
* Response generation from legal knowledge base
* System evaluation using accuracy and response relevance

---

## 📊 Results

The chatbot demonstrates satisfactory accuracy in handling frequently asked legal questions with minimal response time. The system effectively provides relevant and understandable legal information, making it suitable for public use.

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

* Integration of transformer-based models (BERT)
* Multilingual support
* Voice-based interaction
* Real-time legal document summarization
* Cloud deployment for scalability
